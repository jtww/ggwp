A project I had embarked on to take a look at the video game industry through exploratory analysis to identify any possible trend(s) and generate insight for future decision-making.

There are five jupyter notebooks in total - one on the industry as a whole; one each for three top-selling publishers that I had identified from the dataset, and one for a simple dashboard created using Plotly Dash for Jupyter. As the dashboard cannot be loaded offline, the dashboard demo is available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gF93zEcDrPQ1qaBRzofjeAZZjK4BsZJp/view?usp=share_link">here</a> instead.
